### What's on the Menu

### Decision
We're gonna use **APIs** to keep the menu data up-to-date.

### Rationale
APIs are a reliable way to sync data. This way, we can make sure our app always shows the latest menus.

### Consequences
We'll have to work with each restaurant to understand their inventory system and API. This could make integration a bit more complex and time-consuming.
