## Figuring Out Location

### Decision
We're gonna use the **GPS** on your phone to figure out where you are.

### Rationale
GPS is super accurate and works on all smartphones. This way, we can show you restaurants close to you, estimate how long your food will take to arrive, and show you what's nearby.

### Consequences
We'll need to ask you if it's cool for us to use your location. If you say no, we'll have to handle that.
