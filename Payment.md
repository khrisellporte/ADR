## Payment

### Decision
We're gonna use **Stripe** to handle payments.

### Rationale
Stripe is super secure and works in lots of places. Plus, their fees are straightforward.

### Consequences
We'll have to stick to Stripe's rules and integrate with their API. This might limit the payment methods we can accept to just the ones Stripe supports.
