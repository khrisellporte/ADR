* Native, Web, or Hybrid App: So, we gotta decide if we’re going for a native, web, or hybrid app. Native apps are super fast and can use all the phone’s features, but we’d have to write separate code for each platform (like iOS and Android). Web apps work on any platform, but they might not be as fast or use all the phone’s features. Hybrid apps are a bit of both - they use web tech but can still use some of the phone’s features.***

* UI Framework: We need to pick a UI framework. If we’re going native, we could use Swift UI for iOS or Jetpack Compose for Android. If we’re going web or hybrid, we could use something like React or Vue.js for web, or React Native or Flutter for hybrid.***

* Backend Language: We gotta pick a language for the backend. We could go with Node.js if we want something fast and JavaScript-based. Python is also cool because it’s easy to read and has awesome frameworks like Django and Flask. Java and .NET are also solid choices, especially for big enterprise apps.***

* Permissions: Our app will probably need to ask the user if it can use certain features or data on their phone. We gotta make sure we only ask for what we need and let the user know why we need it.***

* Data Storage: We need to decide if we’re going with a SQL or NoSQL database. SQL databases like MySQL or PostgreSQL are great for structured data, while NoSQL databases like MongoDB are better for unstructured data. For storing data on the client-side in web apps, we could use cookies, localStorage, or IndexedDB. *

* Additional Frameworks or Technology Stacks: We might need some extra libraries or tools for stuff like routing (like React-Router for React apps), managing app state (like Redux or MobX), styling (like Styled-components or CSS modules), or even a more comprehensive framework like Next.js for React that includes server-side rendering and routing. *
