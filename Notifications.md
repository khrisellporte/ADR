### Notifications

### Decision
We're gonna use **Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM)** to send you notifications.

### Rationale
FCM is a reliable service for sending notifications. It works on both Android and iOS.

### Consequences
We'll have to handle integrating with FCM and managing notifications. This includes handling cases where you decide to opt out of notifications.
