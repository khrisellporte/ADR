### Your Order History

### Decision
We're gonna use a **cloud-based SQL database** to store your order history.

### Rationale
A SQL database lets us efficiently store and retrieve your past orders. Storing this data in the cloud means you can access it from any device.

### Consequences
We'll have to make sure the data access is secure and handle syncing between the app and the database. This will make it easy for you to see your past orders and reorder your favorite items.
