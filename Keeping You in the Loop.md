## Keeping You in the Loop

### Decision
We're gonna use **WebSockets** to give you real-time updates on your order.

### Rationale
WebSockets let us chat with the server in real-time, which is perfect for keeping you updated.

### Consequences
This means we'll have to manage WebSocket connections and make sure the data stays consistent. But we think it's worth it for the awesome user experience.
